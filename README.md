# bioimage analysis study
master microscopy image analysis from scratch with project-based learning

Overall, I would suggest to take a four-stage plan for this learning:
1. Get familiar with basic image analysis concepts using common softwares (ImageJ or Napari) without coding
2. Get familiar with Python programming via learning the basic of machine learning for computer vision
3. Work on real projects with Python 
4. Think through the algorithms like a computer scientist

## Common questions before we start

1. "I have no experience with coding. Can I learn?"

First of all, image analysis is NOT equal to coding. As you can see from my proposed study plan, everything starts with understanding the concepts and methods. There are so many well-established tools for you to understand these methods without writing a single line of code. Then, knowing how to write code just gives you more flexibility to use these methods so as to make customized solutions suitable for your problem. At the end, you will not stop at coding. Ultimately, the most difficult part is to able to develop new algorithms to solve the problem which no existing algorithm can do.

In short, coding is just a tool to help you do image analysis effectively and efficiently. It is neither absolutely required to start learning, nor the most important part for mastering image analysis. The key is the method / algorithm.

2. Is image analysis all about deep learning?

Absolutely not. Machine learning based solutions are just one type of many methods. For some problems, they might be very powerful. But, in a lot of the scenarios, they are neither necessary, nor the best.
